# Overview

This app uses a variation of a Vigenere Cipher to allow the user to encrypt and decipher text.
The user inputs a passcode and text to encrypt, and the app outputs the encrypted text in real time.
The user can also switch the setting to decrypt instead of encrypt.

The purpose for creating this app was to learn the basics of app development.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used the software Android Studio and the Java language.
The app itself uses listeners to respond to the user's inputs.
